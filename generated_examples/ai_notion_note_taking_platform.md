# Project Blueprint: AI-Enhanced Notion Note-Taking Platform

## 1. Executive Summary

This project aims to build an AI-powered note-taking platform that integrates with Notion, enabling users to capture, summarize, and organize meeting notes, diagrams, and structured content. The solution leverages Notion's API, AI models (OpenAI/Ollama), and modular architecture to provide a scalable, secure, and extensible system for knowledge management. The core problem is fragmented note-taking workflows, and the solution is a unified platform combining AI-driven summarization, OCR, and diagramming capabilities within Notion.

## 2. Technology Stack Recommendation

| Category           | Technology / Framework                   | Justification                                                          | Trade-offs / Limitations                                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend**       | Python (FastAPI) + HTML/JavaScript       | High performance for APIs; supports real-time features via WebSocket   | Requires separate frontend development for UI (optional)              |
| **Backend**        | Python (FastAPI) + Pydantic + SQLAlchemy | Fast, async-friendly, and scalable; supports ORM and schema validation | Limited built-in UI; requires frontend integration                    |
| **Database**       | PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy ORM              | ACID-compliant, scalable, and supports complex queries                 | Slightly steeper learning curve than NoSQL for schema-heavy use cases |
| **Deployment**     | Docker + Kubernetes                      | Containerization for portability; orchestration for scalability        | Overhead for small-scale deployments                                  |
| **Authentication** | Notion API + OAuth2 + JWT                | Leverages Noting's existing user base; secure token-based auth         | Limited customization of Notion's authentication flow                 |

### Key Design Patterns

| Pattern Name              | Where to Apply                           | Rationale                                    | Trade-offs / Notes                            |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Model-View-Controller** | `/api-server/controllers/`               | Separates API logic from business rules      | Requires careful separation of concerns       |
| **Repository Pattern**    | `/api-server/repositories/`              | Decouples data access from business logic    | Adds abstraction layer for DB interactions    |
| **Strategy Pattern**      | `/api-server/services/ocr_strategies.py` | Swappable OCR engines (e.g., Tesseract, PIL) | Requires interface definition for flexibility |
| **Factory Pattern**       | `/api-server/factories/`                 | Centralized creation of AI model instances   | Reduces duplication in service initialization |
| **Dependency Injection**  | Service constructors + FastAPI Depends   | Enables testing without external services    | Requires careful setup of dependency graph    |
| **Context Manager**       | `/api-server/db/session_manager.py`      | Ensures DB session cleanup on exit           | Must handle exceptions gracefully             |

## 4. Phased Development Plan (MVP to Full Launch)

- [ ] **Feature:** Integrate Notion API for note creation/editing
- [ ] **Feature:** OCR for scanned document conversion
- [ ] **Chore:** Set up Docker/Kubernetes for deployment
- [ ] **Chore:** Implement JWT authentication for API endpoints

### **Phase 2: Core Features (V1.0)**

- [ ] **Feature:** AI meeting note summarization (OpenAI)
- [ ] **Feature:** Diagram embedding with draw.io integration
- [ ] **Chore:** Add PostgreSQL ORM models for note metadata
- [ ] **Chore:** Implement rate limiting and input validation

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features (V1.1+)**

- [ ] **Feature:** Ollama model integration for local inference
- [ ] **Feature:** Advanced search with semantic similarity
- [ ] **Chore:** Add OpenAPI documentation and API sandbox
- [ ] **Chore:** Deploy CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

## 5. Key Best Practices

- **Version Control:** Trunk-based flow with semantic commits; PR checks for code quality
- **Testing:**
  - Unit tests (pytest) for business logic
  - Integration tests (docker-compose) for API/database interactions
  - E2E tests (Playwright) for Notion API workflows
- **Code Quality:**
  - Linting (ruff) and formatting (black) enforced via pre-commit hooks
  - Type-checking (mypy) for all service layers
- **Security:**
  - OWASP Top-10 compliance (e.g., XSS, CSRF)
  - Dependency scanning (Trivy) for third-party libraries
  - Secrets management (Vault) for API keys
- **Documentation:**
  - ADRs in `/docs/adr/` for architectural decisions
  - OpenAPI docs generated automatically
  - README badges for CI/CD status and coverage
