# Project: Tailored Cover Letter Generator with Python + LangGraph Agent

## 🎯 What Am I Building?

A sophisticated Python agent integrated with LangGraph Studio that generates personalized cover letters by intelligently combining a user's CV content with job advertisements. Architecturally, it showcases clean code, strong adherence to SOLID principles, and well-chosen design patterns without relying on databases or UI, emphasizing maintainability, extensibility, and testability — perfect for an impressive portfolio piece.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: None (interaction via LangGraph Studio interface, focusing on backend/agent logic)
- **Backend**: Python 3.10+ (for typing features and modern language constructs), LangGraph SDK for building agent workflows and state management
- **Database**: None (stateless or file-based state handling only, no persistence DB)
- **Testing**: pytest for unit and integration tests; use mock for simulating LangGraph interactions
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions for CI/CD; package as a Python module runnable locally or in cloud environments supporting Python

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Patterns

### System Architecture Overview

The system follows a layered architecture: domain models encapsulate CV and job ad data; repositories abstract data sourcing (e.g., file or API parsers); services contain business logic for cover letter generation; strategies enable interchangeable parsing and generation algorithms; factories handle creation of domain objects and letter variants; commands encapsulate agent actions in LangGraph workflows; observers manage event notifications. Dependency Injection decouples components, enhancing testability and maintainability.

### SOLID Principles Implementation

- **Single Responsibility**: Each class/module has one responsibility, e.g., parsers only parse, generators only generate letters, LangGraph nodes handle orchestration. This prevents classes from becoming monolithic and simplifies testing.
- **Open/Closed**: Use abstract base classes and interfaces for parsers and generators so new parsing strategies or letter formats can be added without modifying existing code (e.g., add a new CV parser by subclassing an abstract parser).
- **Liskov Substitution**: Subclasses of parsing or generation strategies can be substituted without breaking client code, ensuring polymorphism works reliably.
- **Interface Segregation**: Interfaces are kept minimal; for example, a parser interface only exposes parsing methods without forcing unrelated methods.
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules (e.g., services) depend on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete classes, enabling dependency injection and easier mocking in tests.

### Design Patterns Usage

| Pattern    | Location/Module     | Purpose                                                     | Implementation Notes                                                               |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Repository | `src/repositories/` | Abstract and encapsulate data access (CV, job ad parsers)   | Provides clean separation of data extraction from business logic                   |
| Factory    | `src/factories/`    | Create cover letter objects and parser instances            | Centralized object creation to manage complexity and support open/closed principle |
| Strategy   | `src/strategies/`   | Implement interchangeable parsing and generation algorithms | Enables swapping and extending parsing/generation without modifying clients        |
| Command    | `src/commands/`     | Encapsulate LangGraph agent actions                         | Commands represent discrete workflow steps, improving modularity and testability   |
| Observer   | `src/events/`       | Event handling within the LangGraph workflow                | Decouples event emission (e.g., logging, notifications) from core logic            |

## 📅 Build Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation & Clean Architecture (Week 1-3)

- Define domain models with type annotations
- Create abstract interfaces for parsers and generators
- Implement basic CV and job ad parsers (Strategy pattern)
- Implement CoverLetterGenerator service using dependency inversion
- Set up dependency injection container (e.g., `injector` or manual DI)
- Define custom exceptions and validation logic
- Integrate basic LangGraph workflow with Command pattern for agent steps
- Implement initial unit tests for parsers and services
- Add basic logging setup (e.g., Python `logging` module)

### Phase 2: Core Features & Patterns (Week 4-6)

- Extend parsing strategies for multiple formats
- Implement Factory pattern for creating parsers and cover letter variants
- Add Strategy pattern for different cover letter generation styles
- Implement Observer pattern for event handling (e.g., generation started/completed)
- Enhance error handling with rich exception hierarchy and fallback strategies
- Expand LangGraph workflow sophistication (subgraphs, parallelization if applicable)
- Write integration tests covering LangGraph workflows and services

### Phase 3: Enhancement & Polish (Week 7-8)

- Add optional features (multiple cover letter tones, logging events)
- Optimize code and improve documentation (docstrings, README with architecture diagrams)
- Achieve high test coverage (>80%)
- Prepare GitHub repository with clean structure, CI/CD pipeline, and badges
- Create demo scripts and architecture explanation for portfolio presentation

## 🧪 Testing & Quality Strategy

### Testing Approach

- **Unit Tests**: Test each parser, generator, and service independently using mocks as needed
- **Integration Tests**: Validate end-to-end workflows, including LangGraph agent executions
- **Architecture Tests**: Use tools like `pytest` plugins or custom scripts to verify dependency rules (e.g., no direct coupling to concrete classes)
- **Test Coverage**: Target >80% coverage on core business logic and workflows

### Code Quality Measures

- **Type Safety**: Use Python 3.10+ type hints; run mypy in CI
- **Code Style**: Enforce formatting with `black` and lint with `pylint`
- **Documentation**: Docstrings on all public classes and functions; architecture and design decisions documented in markdown files
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive custom exceptions with hierarchy, clear error messages, and recovery paths
- **Logging**: Use structured logging with appropriate levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) placed at service entry/exit points, parsing steps, and error handlers
