# Project Blueprint: AI-Powered Note-Taking Application

## 1. Executive Summary

This project delivers a scalable, AI-enhanced note-taking application with real-time collaboration, voice-to-text conversion, and intelligent search. The solution leverages Python (FastAPI) for the backend, React for the frontend, and PostgreSQL for data storage. Key features include natural language processing for summarization, secure user authentication, and modular architecture for extensibility.

## 2. Technology Stack Recommendation

| Category           | Technology / Framework  | Justification                                                               | Trade-offs / Limitations                                                        |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend**       | React (with TypeScript) | Component-based architecture, rich UI capabilities, and ecosystem maturity  | Steeper learning curve for state management compared to simpler frameworks      |
| **Backend**        | FastAPI (Python)        | High-performance async framework, built-in OpenAPI support, and type safety | Less mature than Django for complex business logic compared to other frameworks |
| **Database**       | PostgreSQL              | ACID compliance, robust JSONB support, and scalability for structured data  | Slightly steeper learning curve for advanced features like full-text search     |
| **Deployment**     | Docker + Kubernetes     | Containerization for consistency, orchestration for scalability             | Complexity in managing stateful services like PostgreSQL                        |
| **Authentication** | Auth0 (OAuth 2.0)       | Secure, scalable identity management with built-in social logins            | Additional latency from third-party service integration                         |

### Key Design Patterns

| Pattern Name              | Where to Apply                         | Rationale                                                              | Trade-offs / Notes                               |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Model-View-Controller** | /api-server/models, /frontend/src      | Separates data, UI, and logic for scalability and testability          | Requires careful state management in frontend    |
| **Repository Pattern**    | /api-server/repositories               | Decouples data access logic from business logic, enabling multiple DBs | Increased complexity in query abstraction        |
| **Strategy Pattern**      | /api-server/services/search_strategies | Swappable search algorithms (e.g., full-text vs. semantic search)      | Requires careful interface definition            |
| **Factory Pattern**       | /api-server/factories                  | Centralized creation of complex objects (e.g., database sessions)      | Can introduce coupling if not designed carefully |
| **Dependency Injection**  | Service constructors & FastAPI Depends | Enables unit testing and loose coupling between components             | Requires careful inversion of control            |
| **Context Manager**       | /api-server/db/session_manager.py      | Ensures proper DB session cleanup and transaction management           | Must handle exceptions gracefully                |

## 4. Phased Development Plan (MVP to Full Launch)

### **Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**

- [ ] **Feature:** User authentication (OAuth 2.0 via Auth0)
- [ ] **Feature:** Basic note creation, storage, and retrieval
- [ ] **Chore:** Setup Dockerized development environment
- [ ] **Chore:** Implement PostgreSQL schema for notes and users

### **Phase 2: Core Features (V1.0)**

- [ ] **Feature:** Real-time collaboration (WebSockets)
- [ ] **Feature:** Voice-to-text conversion with transcription history
- [ ] **Feature:** Full-text search with relevance ranking
- [ ] **Chore:** Implement OpenAPI documentation for API endpoints
- [ ] **Chore:** Add rate-limiting and input validation

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features (V1.1+)**

- [ ] **Feature:** AI-powered note summarization and tag suggestions
- [ ] **Feature:** Export notes to PDF/Markdown formats
- [ ] **Feature:** Collaborative editing with conflict resolution
- [ ] **Chore:** Integrate dependency scanning for security vulnerabilities

## 5. Key Best Practices

- **Version Control:** Trunk-based flow with semantic commits (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`). PRs require automated tests and code reviews.
- **Testing:**
  - Unit tests (pytest) for business logic in `/tests/unit`
  - Integration tests (docker-compose) for database interactions
  - E2.Tests (Playwright) for frontend workflows
- **Code Quality:**
  - Linting (ruff) and formatting (black) enforced via pre-commit hooks
  - Type-checking (mypy) for Python code
- **Security:**
  - OWASP Top-10 compliance checks via Snyk
  - Secrets management via Vault or environment variables
- **Documentation:**
  - ADRs in `/docs/adr` for architectural decisions
  - API docs via OpenAPI in `/docs/api`
  - README badges for CI/CD status and coverage
