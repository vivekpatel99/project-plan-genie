# Project: Agent-Powered AI Note-Taking App

## 🎯 What Am I Building?

An innovative AI note-taking app driven by OCR, multi-agent orchestration via LangGraph, and integration with Notion. This project will highlight your expertise in clean architecture, SOLID principles, and modern AI solutions. It provides a smooth way to convert handwritten notes into structured digital text and diagrams, with a focus on flexibility and scalability.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: FastAPI for rapid development and easy integration with modern frontend frameworks.
- **Backend**: Python with LangGraph to orchestrate agent operations, ensuring a clean, decoupled system.
- **Database**: SQLite for lightweight storage with potential to swap for more robust options using the Repository pattern.
- **Testing**: pytest for comprehensive testing, focusing on unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- **Deployment**: Docker with CI/CD pipelines on GitHub Actions for reliable and repeatable deployments.

- [ ] Basic Multi-Agent Orchestration - Utilize LangGraph for task coordination - *Patterns: Command*
- [ ] Notion Integration - Send processed notes to Notion - *Patterns: Adapter*

### Nice to Have (Phase 2: Enhancement)

- [ ] LaTeX Equation Processing - Convert images of equations into LaTeX code - *Patterns: Strategy, Factory*
- [ ] Dynamic Diagram Extraction - Extract diagrams and concept maps - *Patterns: Strategy*

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Patterns

### System Architecture Overview

The system employs a modular backend using Python, designed as a monolithic structure that could evolve into microservices. Key components include OCR processing, agent orchestration, and front-end integrations. LangGraph facilitates flexible orchestration and clean separation of task responsibilities.

### SOLID Principles Implementation

- **Single Responsibility**: Each service component (e.g., OCR, Notion integration) handles a distinct task.
- **Open/Closed**: Use abstract OCR interfaces to allow adding new OCR engines without modifying existing code.
- **Liskov Substitution**: Implement interchangeable OCR strategies (e.g., Tesseract, EasyOCR).
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients only depend on the interfaces they use for specific operations (e.g., Notion API calls).
- **Dependency Inversion**: Higher-level modules control flows; use dependency injection for agent tasks.

### Design Patterns Usage

| Pattern    | Location/Module     | Purpose                       | Implementation Notes                       |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Repository | `src/repositories/` | Abstract data access          | Facilitates switching between data sources |
| Strategy   | `src/strategies/`   | OCR and LaTeX processing      | Enables easy substitution                  |
| Adapter    | `src/adapters/`     | 3rd party integration         | Abstracts Notion API interactions          |
| Command    | `src/commands/`     | Orchestrate complex workflows | Encapsulates agent operations              |
