## Project Planner Agent: GitHub Task List

Copy and paste the following into a GitHub Issue, Project, or TODO.md file to track your progress[1][2][3]:

### Phase 1: MVP Core

- [ ] Set up LangGraph StateGraph with a basic project context state
- [ ] Implement a single planner agent with simple prompt templates
- [ ] Create a CLI interface for quick testing and validation
- [ ] Develop logic to decompose project ideas into actionable tasks
- [ ] Define a basic `ProjectState` structure (TypedDict or dataclass)

### Phase 2: Enhanced Planning

- [ ] Add multi-agent architecture (clarification and validation agents)
- [ ] Implement conditional workflows for project complexity
- [ ] Build a question generation agent for unclear requirements
- [ ] Refactor prompt management to use templates for easy updates

### Phase 3: Production Ready

- [ ] Abstract model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) using the Strategy Pattern
- [ ] Add robust error handling and retry mechanisms
- [ ] Optimize token usage (prompt engineering, response caching)
- [ ] Implement state persistence (save/resume planning sessions)

### Phase 4: Portfolio Polish

- [ ] Develop a clean web interface (or use LangGraph's UI)
- [ ] Write comprehensive documentation (README, technical docs)
- [ ] Deploy a live demo (cloud deployment)
- [ ] Add performance metrics (token usage, response time)

### Design Patterns & Architecture

- [ ] Implement Strategy Pattern for model provider switching
- [ ] Use Template Method Pattern for agent logic
- [ ] Apply Factory Pattern for agent creation/management
- [ ] Integrate Observer Pattern for state change tracking

### Efficiency & Optimization

- [ ] Design reusable, concise prompt templates
- [ ] Add response caching for repeated project breakdowns
- [ ] Use conditional processing to minimize expensive operations
- [ ] Enable streaming responses for faster feedback

### Project Structure & Best Practices

- [ ] Organize codebase into logical modules (agents, core, providers, prompts, utils, ui)
- [ ] Add type hints and Google-style docstrings
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests for core logic
- [ ] Set up linting (Black, pylint)
- [ ] Generate API documentation (Sphinx)

### Advanced Features (Optional)

- [ ] Implement intelligent clarification agent for ambiguous requirements
- [ ] Support multi-modal input (text, voice, document upload)
- [ ] Generate visual project timelines and export plans (PDF, Gantt, markdown)
- [ ] Integrate with external tools (GitHub, Jira, Trello)

### Technical Implementation

- [ ] Configure LangGraph workflow with intake, clarify, plan, and validate nodes
- [ ] Add conditional edges for workflow branching
- [ ] Implement error handling: circuit breaker, retry logic, graceful degradation

### Portfolio & Documentation

- [ ] Create Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- [ ] Document performance analysis and optimization results
- [ ] Write an extension guide for new agents/integrations
- [ ] Add deployment instructions (Docker, cloud)

### Risk Mitigation

- [ ] Implement request queuing/caching for API rate limits
- [ ] A/B test prompt engineering approaches
- [ ] Use LangGraph persistence for state management
