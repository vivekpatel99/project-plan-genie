The app should capture handwritten notes, automatically format them (including equations and diagrams), classify content into the correct Notion section, and upload the processed notes with rich formatting. I aim to implement an MVP capable of image-to-text conversion and formatting within two weeks. What specific features of the note-taking app are most important to showcase my skills in computer vision, multi-agent systems, and end-to-end AI engineering?
