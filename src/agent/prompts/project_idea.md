create plan to develop Agentic AI note taking app using langgraph for my personal use (personal project for fun and learning) and i also want to show off my skills to my potential interviewer to get hired. it should do following:

1. take pictures of hand-written notes
2. it will automatically format the hand-written notes (it might contains equations and block diagrams)
3. find proper section (if section found then create sub page or create a new page) in my notion
4. add this notes with proper format
5. i want to use LangGraph's pre-build UI for interaction from PC
6. for MVP (which can convert image to text and format it properly) in 2 weeks
7. I am also thinking to use multi agent system one agent for image to text conversion and 2nd agent for text to notion or formatting (markdown)
