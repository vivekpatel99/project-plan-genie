## üìÖ Build Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation & Clean Architecture (Week 1-3)
**Goal**: Establish solid architectural foundation
- Set up project structure following clean architecture principles
- Implement core domain models with proper type hints
- Create repository interfaces and implementations
- Set up dependency injection container
- Implement basic logging and error handling
- Write foundational unit tests

### Phase 2: Core Features & Patterns (Week 4-6)
**Goal**: Build main functionality with design patterns
- Implement core business logic using service layer
- Apply Factory pattern for object creation
- Use Strategy pattern for algorithm variations
- Implement Command pattern for operations
- Add comprehensive error handling with custom exceptions
- Expand test coverage (unit + integration)

### Phase 3: Enhancement & Polish (Week 7-8)
**Goal**: Make it portfolio-ready with advanced features
- Add remaining features using established patterns
- Implement Observer pattern for event handling
- Performance optimization and caching
- Comprehensive documentation and README
- Add screenshots, demo, and architecture diagrams

## üß™ Testing & Quality Strategy

### Testing Approach
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **Architecture Tests**: Verify dependency rules and patterns
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for >80% coverage on business logic

### Code Quality Measures
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints with mypy validation
- **Code Style**: Automated formatting with black/prettier
- **Linting**: Static analysis with pylint/eslint
- **Documentation**: Docstrings for all public interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception hierarchy
