# project-planning-genie

An intelligent AI-powered project planning agent that transforms project descriptions into comprehensive, actionable implementation plans. Built with LangGraph and multi-agent architecture to deliver structured markdown reports perfect for GitHub issues and project management.

## 🚀 Overview

This project planning agent helps developers and teams break down complex project ideas into manageable, step-by-step implementation plans. By leveraging advanced AI agents and workflow orchestration, it generates detailed project roadmaps that can be directly used as GitHub issues, project boards, or documentation.

**Key Features:**

- **Intelligent Project Analysis**: Automatically decomposes project descriptions into actionable tasks
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents for clarification, planning, and validation
- **Markdown Report Generation**: Outputs formatted plans ready for GitHub issues
- **Extensible Design**: Built with modern software engineering patterns for easy enhancement

## 🎯 What It Does

1. **Project Intake**: Accepts natural language project descriptions
2. **Requirement Clarification**: Asks intelligent questions to resolve ambiguities
3. **Task Decomposition**: Breaks down projects into logical phases and tasks
4. **Plan Generation**: Creates structured markdown reports with checkboxes and priorities
5. **Validation**: Reviews and refines plans for completeness and feasibility
